# publiccodebumper

A script made in Processing 3.0 to generate videopodcast bumper animation.

When producing podcasts you need to present and introduction video for people who are joing the live stream so they know the stream is online and active.

However we cannot use a static video because topics an guests change. In order not to have to produce / render a new video for every episode this script will generate this introduction video automatically. By setting a few variables you can configure how long the video should be, what the topic is and who the guests are.
